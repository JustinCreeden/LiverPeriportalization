## Influence of liver fibrosis on lobular zonation: replacement of pericentral by periportal features supports adaptation to repeated doses of hepatotoxic compounds


### Abtract

Little is known how liver fibrosis influences lobular zonation. To address this question, we used three mouse models of liver fibrosis, repeated CCl4 administration for 2, 6 and 12 months, bile duct ligation (21 days), and eight as well as 64 week-old mdr2-/- mice. Analyses were performed by RNA-seq, immunostaining of zonated proteins and image analysis. RNA-seq demonstrated a significant enrichment of pericentral genes among genes downregulated by CCl4; vice versa periportal genes were enriched among the upregulated genes. Immunostaining showed an almost complete loss of pericentral proteins, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes and glutamine synthetase, while periportal proteins, such as arginase and CPS1 became expressed also in pericentral hepatocytes. This pattern of fibrosis associated ‘periportalization’ was consistently observed in all three mouse models and led to complete resistance to hepatotoxic doses of   (200 mg/kg). Characterization of the expression response identified the inflammatory pathways TGFβ, NFκB, TNFα, and transcription factors NFKb1, Stat1, Hif1a, Trp53, and Atf1 among the activated, while estrogen associated pathways, Hnf4a and Hnf1a were decreased. In conclusion, liver fibrosis leads to strong alterations of lobular zonation, where the pericentral region adopts periportal features. Beside adverse consequences, periportalization supports adaptation to repeated doses of hepatotoxic compounds.
